# 🏰 theVault

Welcome to **theVault**! This is a prototype darknet vendor store inspired by:

1. Goldhat Free Market
2. The 2024 novel ["Baby X" by Kira Peikoff](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/baby-x-kira-peikoff/1143604735), which explores a near-future darknet vendor store for selling DNA.

Goldhat itself was a PHP upgrade and security enhancement fork of Eckmar's Marketplace v2.0.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**theVault** is a transformation of previous projects into a fully functional vendor store. It builds upon the foundations laid by Eckmar's Market and Goldhat Free Market, updating the codebase to utilize **Laravel 11** and **PHP 8.3.x**.

This project has been tested on Debian and Fedora. Fedora is recommended on the basis that Debian is cruddy and basic. It probably runs fine on almost any linux but you'll need to update the installer commands (change dnf or apt to whatever you're using and map the package names to those for your distro).

### ⚙️ Features

- **Modern Framework**: Built on Laravel 11 for enhanced performance and maintainability.
- **Security Enhancements**: Initial security patches and hardening based on Goldhat's updates.
- **User Restrictions**: Limited user actions to prevent abuse and ensure compliance.

## 📦 Installation

To get started with **theVault**, follow these steps:

1. Run the initial configuration script:
   `./fedora_installer_part1.sh`

2. Follow the instructions in `the_manual_mariadb_step.txt` to set up your MariaDB database.

3. Complete the installation by running:
   `./fedora_installer_part2.sh`

## ⚠️ Status and Important Notes (MUST READ)

- As of mid-February 2025, **advanced security and pentesting** features have **NOT** yet been added to the project. 
- Extra Nginx hardening is also pending. If you plan to put a clone or fork online, please ensure you handle these components yourself or consider hiring me for assistance.

## 🎩 Friendly Advice

Big Brother leverages the Eye of Sauron and has many dungeons. The darknet is filled with hackers and LEAs. If you're thinking of using this code to run a drug market/store or other illegal activities, please rethink it. You'll get yourself into trouble. Use this to learn or to give the so-called dark net some much needed, original, non-illegal functionality. If you have money to invest and want a few ideas as well as a business partner, drop me a line.
