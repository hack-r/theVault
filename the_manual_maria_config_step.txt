This part was not working well as part of the automated configuration script.

	mysql -u root -p
	CREATE DATABASE marketplace DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
	exit

The second 2 lines above are run within the MariaDB shell. Back to bash (or Zsh, etc.) please be sure to run:

	mysql_secure_installation

and accept all of the security recommendations(!). This is a darknet store. People and bots will begin trying to hack it instantly. OK, now let's also verify that PHP is working fine, is up to date (8.3+), etc.

	php -v

It should say PHP 8.3 or higher. If PHP 9 has come out when you're using this then that will likely be too new, although you can try it. We need to edit the php.ini file:

	sudo nano /etc/php.ini

Inside this file, find the line cgi.fix_pathinfo and set it to cgi.fix_pathinfo=0. You will probably need to uncomment it. Then restart PHP:

	sudo systemctl restart php-fpm

If you want to install elasticsearch from a package manager instead of the 'manual' download in the next installer script, you can add the repo for your Linux version. For Fedora and other RPM-based distros, it would be a file called elasticsearch.repo in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory for RedHat based distributions, or in the /etc/zypp/repos.d/ directory for OpenSuSE based distributions, containing:

	[elasticsearch]
	name=Elasticsearch repository for 8.x packages
	baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/yum
	gpgcheck=1
	gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
	enabled=0
	autorefresh=1
	type=rpm-md


Make sure you get the signing file:

	rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
